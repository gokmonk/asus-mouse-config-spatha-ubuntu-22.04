## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyQt6

### Step 1: Clone or Download

```bash
# Clone the repository (if using git)
git clone <repository-url>
cd rog-spatha-controller

# Or download the single Python file directly
wget <file-url>/mouse_controller.py
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using pip
pip install PyQt6

# Using conda
conda install pyqt

# On Ubuntu/Debian systems, you might also need:
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt6
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

```bash
python mouse_controller.py
```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Setup

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the Python script to open the controller interface
2. **Configure DPI**: Use the slider to set your preferred sensitivity (400-19,000 DPI)
3. **Set Polling Rate**: Choose your desired polling rate from the dropdown menu
4. **Map Buttons**: Configure each of the 12 programmable buttons according to your needs

### Button Configuration

Each button can be configured with different functions:

- **Standard Functions**: Left Click, Right Click, Middle Click, Scroll Up/Down, DPI Up/Down
- **Keystroke**: Enter custom key combinations (e.g., `Ctrl+C`, `Alt+Tab`, `F1`)
- **Macro**: Record complex key sequences using the built-in macro recorder
- **Application**: Launch specific applications or scripts
- **Disabled**: Completely disable the button

### Creating Macros

1. Select "Macro" from the function dropdown for any button
2. Click the "Record Macro" button
3. In the macro recorder dialog, click "Start Recording"
4. Perform the key sequence you want to record
5. Click "Stop Recording" and then "OK" to save

### Profile Management

1. Switch to the "Profiles" tab
2. Select a profile from the dropdown (Default, Gaming, Office, Custom 1, Custom 2)
3. Configure your mouse settings as desired
4. Add a description in the text area
5. Click "Save Profile" to store your configuration
6. Use "Load Profile" to restore saved settings

### Advanced Settings

- **Angle Snapping**: Enable for perfectly straight lines in drawing applications
- **Surface Calibration**: Choose your mouse pad type for optimal tracking
- **Apply All Settings**: Confirm and apply all current configurations

## File Structure

```
rog-spatha-controller/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mouse_controller.py          # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # This documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile_default.json       # Default profile (auto-generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile_gaming.json         # Gaming profile (auto-generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile_office.json         # Office profile (auto-generated)

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ profile_custom_2.json       # Custom profile 2 (auto-generated)
```

## Configuration Files

Profiles are saved as JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Gaming",
  "description": "High DPI gaming setup with macro buttons",
  "dpi": 12000,
  "polling_rate": "1000Hz",
  "buttons": {
    "0": {
      "function": "Left Click",
      "parameter": ""
    },
    "1": {
      "function": "Macro",
      "parameter": "Ctrl+C + Ctrl+V"
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt6'"**
- Install PyQt6 using: `pip install PyQt6`

**Application doesn't start**
- Ensure you're using Python 3.8 or higher
- Check that all dependencies are installed correctly

**Profile files not saving/loading**
- Ensure the application has write permissions in its directory
- Check that the JSON files aren't corrupted

**Mouse settings not applying**
- This is a GUI mockup - actual hardware communication requires mouse drivers
- The interface demonstrates the configuration options available

## Hardware Integration

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This application provides a complete GUI interface for mouse configuration but does not include actual hardware communication code. To make it functional with real ROG SPATHA hardware, you would need to:

1. Install ASUS ROG software/drivers
2. Integrate with the mouse's API or driver interface
3. Add hardware communication protocols

The current implementation serves as a comprehensive template and mockup for what such software would look like.

## Development

### Code Structure

- **MouseController**: Main application window and controller
- **ButtonConfigWidget**: Individual button configuration interface
- **MacroRecorderDialog**: Macro recording functionality
- **ProfileManager**: Profile save/load management

### Extending the Application

The modular design makes it easy to add new features:

- Add new button functions in `ButtonConfigWidget`
- Extend macro recording capabilities in `MacroRecorderDialog`
- Add new profile types in `ProfileManager`
- Integrate hardware communication protocols
